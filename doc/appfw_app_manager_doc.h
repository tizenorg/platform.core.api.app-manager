 * @section CAPI_APPLICATION_MANAGER_MODULE_OVERVIEW Overview
 * The @ref CAPI_APPLICATION_MANAGER_MODULE API provides information about applications. There are several different sorts of queries.
 * Two iterator functions step through a list of applications. One is used in running applications(#app_manager_foreach_app_context()), and
 * the other is used in available ("installed") but not necessarily running applications(#app_manager_foreach_app_info()).
 * Each will call a callback function, passing the package name of each application found.
 * A query function will respond whether the application represented by a particular package name is running.
 * Other query functions return static information about an application, such as a name, a type, an icon path, or a version.
 * The API provides functions to manage applications also. By using them, it is possible to resume(#app_manager_resume_app) applications.
